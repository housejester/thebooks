1. First step...create it:
grails create-app oasis

2. Tweak the landing page (inline styles...ick):
edit web-app/index.gsp 
edit web-app/css/main.css

3. Get it into github
Create the github repo then follow the directions to get initial commit in
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
git remote add origin git@github.com:housejester/thebooks.git
git push origin master
Now we're safe.  Lets keep going.

4. Add login form to welcome page
edit web-app/index.gsp
edit web-app/css/main.css

5. Create the User domain object.  It'll just have id, email, and password for now.
grails create-domain-class com.thebooks.domain.User
edit grails-app/domain/com/thebooks/domain/User.groovy to add the fields/constraints

6. Add a user in bootstrap so we can avoid doing registration code for now.
edit grails-app/conf/BootStrap.groovy and add 
new User(email:"admin@test.com",password:"Password").save()
in the init method

7. Create the User Controller (for the login action)
grails create-controller com.thebooks.controllers.User
edit grails-app/controllers/com/thebooks/controllers/UserController.groovy to add in the login action and logic.  We'll
just show a 'login' view on login fail, and redirect to '/' on success
create grails-app/views/user/login.gsp (similar to homepage login form)
tweak web-app/index.gsp to have a session.user check.  If present, show the controller list, otherwise show the login form.

8. Create a better user homepage.
edit grails-app/controller/com/thebooks/controllers/UserController.groovy to add a home action and have the login action
 	redirect to the home action on login success
add grails-app/views/user/home.gsp and drop in the controller list section of index.gsp
take out the controller list from index.gsp and replace it with a link to the user home action.

9.  Add a logout action
edit grails-app/controller/com/thebooks/controllers/UserController.groovy to add a home action
edit grails-app/views/user/home.gsp to have a logout link
